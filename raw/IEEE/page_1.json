      "abstract": "Garbage collection in Java is critical to the performance of Big Data applications. Our study brings forth the causes that invoke the 3 Java garbage collectors for Big Data and non Big Data workloads. We conclude that allocation failure occurs for about 31-99 per cent of the total garbage collector execution time and is the most common cause for garbage collection in Big Data workloads. In case of Dacapo workloads, we observe that the prominent cause for garbage collection is system gc calls which occur for about 40-99 per cent of the total garbage collector execution time.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes an ongoing study using data collected by an instrumented ore car on Vitória–Minas Railway, operated by Vale in Brazil. The research uses big data analysis methods over collected data by the instrumented car during its voyages. Railway geometry issues can cause undesirable movements on the wagons that can cause discomfort for passengers or instability for the cargo. In the worst scenario, derailments can occur. Each second, several sensors installed on the instrumented car collect data about velocity, acceleration, and movements on the wagon. The volume of collected data is impressive since the railway has about 2,000 km of extension. That volume compels us to use big data analytics methods. As the result of the research, the team aims to establish some levels of operational conditions, named as severity indexes, which can indicate to the maintenance teams the necessity of intervention on the railway.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, there was a growing interest in the use of Big Data models to support advanced data analysis functionalities. Many companies and organizations lack IT expertise and adequate budget to have benefits from them. In order to fill this gap, a model-based approach for Big Data Analytics-as-a-service (MBDAaaS) can be used. The proposed model, composed by declarative, procedural and deployment (sub) models, can be used to select a deployable set of services based on a set of user preferences shaping a Big Data Campaign (BDC). The deployment of a BDC requires that the selection of services has to be carried out on the basis of coherent and non conflictual user preferences. In this paper we propose an OWL ontology in order to solve this issue.",

Big Data applications involve the collaborative integration of APIs from different providers. A challenge in this domain is to guarantee the conformance of the integration to privacy terms and regulations. In this paper, we present JPrivacy, a privacy profiling framework for Big Data applications. JPrivacy proposes a model for privacy rules and provide the algorithms and related tools to check Java code against these rules. We show through experimentation that JPrivacy can effectively detect privacy violations by statically analyzing a piece of code.",

      "abstract": "The recent successes of commercial cognitive and AI applications have cast a spotlight on knowledge graphs and the benefits of consuming structured semantic data. Today, knowledge graphs are ubiquitous to the extent that organizations often view them as a “single source of truth” for all of their data and other digital artifacts. In most organizations, however, Big Data comes in many different forms including time series, images, and unstructured text, which often are not suitable for efficient storage within a knowledge graph. This paper presents the Semantics Toolkit (SemTK), a framework that enables access to polyglot-persistent Big Data stores while giving the appearance that all data is fully captured within a knowledge graph. SemTK allows data to be stored across multiple storage platforms (e.g., Big Data stores such as Hadoop, graph databases, and semantic triple stores) - with the best-suited platform adopted for each data type - while maintaining a single logical interface and point of access, thereby giving users a knowledge-driven veneer across their data. We describe the ease of use and benefits of constructing and querying polystore knowledge graphs with SemTK via four industrial use cases at GE.",

The traditional technologies do not become a proper solution to process big data so that a big data platform has begun to emerge. It is certain that big data platform helps users develop analysis service effectively. However, it still takes a long time to collect data, develop algorithms and analytics services. We present a collaborative big data analytics platform for big data as a service. Developers can collaborate with each other on the platform by sharing data, algorithms, and services. Therefore, this paper describes big data analytics platform that effectively supports to manage big data and develop analytics algorithms and services, collaborating with data owners, data scientists, and service developers on the Web. Finally, we introduce a CCTV metadata analytics service developed on the platform.",

Data quality assessment is considered as the foundation of the promotion of data quality, so it is essential to access the data quality before any other data related activities. In the electric power industry, more and more electric power data is continuously accumulated, and many electric power applications have been developed based on these data. In China, the power grid has many special characteristic, traditional big data assessment frameworks cannot be directly applied. Therefore, a big data framework for electric power data quality assessment is proposed. Based on big data techniques, the framework can accumulate both the real-time data and the history data, provide an integrated computation environment for electric power big data assessment, and support the storage of different types of data.",

      "abstract": "Big data analytics has come out as a new important field of study for both researchers and practitioners, demonstrating the significant demand for solutions to business problems in a data-driven knowledge-based economy. Additionally, empirical studies examining the impacts of the nascent technology on organizational performance, especially the influence of organizational culture on the five Big V's of big data, remain scarce. The present study aims to fill the gap. Based on Cameron and Quinn's organizational cultural model, this study proposes a theoretical framework that describes how each type of organizational culture - hierarchy, clan, adhocracy, and market - has impacts on each Big V of big data. The framework suggests that firms, influenced by their organizational culture, have different views on how important each Big V's should be. The study argues that organizations should develop, nurture, and maintain an adhocracy organizational culture that has a positive impact on each of the five Big V's to harness the full potential of big data.",

      "abstract": "A novel random sample partition-based clustering ensemble (RSP-CE) algorithm is proposed in this paper to handle the big data clustering problems. There are three key components in RSP-CE algorithm, i.e., generating the base clustering results on RSP data blocks, harmonizing the based clustering results with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) criterion, and refining the RSP clustering results. RSP data blocks have the consistent sample distributions with the whole big data and thus provide the possibility for using base clustering results on different data subsets to approximate the clustering result on whole big data. The experimental results in comparison with other 5 well-known clustering ensemble algorithms on 4 big data sets show that RSP-CE algorithm obtains the better normalized mutual information (NMI) values and Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI) values with the less training time consumptions and thus demonstrate that RSP-CE algorithm is a viable approach to deal with the big data clustering problems.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, with the continuous development of modern Internet and e-commerce technology, the network data is growing geometrically and the era of big data has come. The massive data information in the network contains a lot of industry resources, and how to properly mine the data information required has become a new issue for enterprises. In this paper, a new data mining and analysis technology is built based on the traditional Apriori mining algorithm and applying the latest Hadoop technology. This technology mainly focuses on the following two aspects. The first is the improvement of the traditional algorithm, which is mainly applied to Hadoop technology to upgrade the traditional data algorithm; the second part is the parallel analysis processing of mining data. The two major parts constitute the new big data mining analysis technology, which provides some references for the current logical data mining and network data applications.",

      "abstract": "The enormous growth of the internet, enterprise applications, social media, and IoT devices in the current time caused a huge spike in enterprise data growth. Big data platform provided scalable storage to manage enterprise data growth and served easier data access to decision-makers, stakeholders and business users. It is a well-known challenge to classify, organize and store all this data and process it to provide business insights. Due to nature, variety, velocity, volume and value of data make it difficult to effectively process big data. Enterprises face challenges to apply complex business rules, to generate insights and to support data-driven decisions in a timely fashion. As big data lake integrates streams of data from a bunch of business units, stakeholders usually analyze enterprise-wide data from various data models. Data models are a vital component of Big data platform. Users may do complex processing, run queries and perform big table joins to generate required metrics depending on the available data models. It is usually a time consuming and resource-intensive process to find the value from data. It is a no-brainer that big data platform in the enterprise needs high-quality data modeling methods to reach an optimal mix of cost, performance, and quality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing an effective and scalable way to organize and store data in Big Data Lake. It presents some of the basic principles and methodology to build scalable data models in a distributed environment. It also describes how it overcomes common challenges and presents findings.",

      "abstract": "To deliver business value, most data-driven enterprises and applications require data to be extracted and merged from otherwise siloed data storage platforms. FDC Cache has been designed and developed to enable the fusion and caching of data drawn from multiple small and/or Big Data stores. This capability executes a sequence of queries, wherein the results from one query may be used to constrain subsequent queries. The results of each query are linked with results from previous queries, incrementally building a cache of semantically linked data that can be used to support multiple independent data requests. FDC Cache uses Semantic Web technologies, and knowledge graphs in particular, to describe the relevant data and relationships in a computable model. This enables applications to reason over the graph, for example to dynamically retrieve targeted subsets of data comprised of previously disparate information. We have successfully applied FDC Cache to two distinct industrial use cases: (i) merging data across multiple sources to assemble information about current parts in a gas turbine, and (ii) dynamically aligning siloed data from electric grid transmission and distribution networks to an industry-standard common model, in which the cache creation time has been shown to scale sub-linearly with the number of data elements. FDC Cache has been open-sourced as part of the GE-developed open source Semantics Toolkit.",

      "abstract": "ER diagrams have a proven track record to rep-resent data structure and relationships, in many CS problems, beyond relational databases. The ER diagram strengths are abstraction, generality, flexibility, and intuitive visual representation, with few weaknesses; hence its popularity. The main con is the old box-diamond-ellipse-line notation, which has been subsumed by the more modern and simpler UML box-line notation. Given the broad, varied, and dynamic nature of big data ER diagrams are mostly ignored, except when the data sources are databases. It is common wisdom raw big data needs significant pre-processing before computing any analytics, resulting in a long chain of data transformations computed in SQL, Python, or R languages, for instance. On the other hand, flow diagrams remain the main mechanism to visualize major components of a software system or main processing steps of an algorithm, showing rectangles (verbs) connected by arrows (processing order, dependence). In this work, we propose to combine both diagrams into one. We propose a hybrid diagram, which we call ER-Flow, based on modern UML notation, to assist analysts in data pre-processing and exploration. Aiming to introduce a minimal change to the ER diagram, we extend relationships lines with an arrow, indicating processing flow and we annotate entities coming from pre-processing with numbers and transformation labels. We illustrate how our novel ER-Flow diagram can help the user navigate big data at the metadata level, providing an integrated view of data and source code, with many practical benefits.",

Advanced analytics are required to improve the reliability and repeatability of additive manufacturing, and those analytics require data. Large volumes of multimodal data are generated and used throughout the additive manufacturing lifecycle, from material design to part design and simulation, part printing to post-processing and inspection. To capture and link that diverse Big Data together, we have designed and developed a federated multimodal Big Data storage and analytics platform comprised of three tiers-a distributed polyglot data storage and analysis tier with different repositories for different data structures, a metadata knowledge graph tier for modeling the data and their relationships across the various repositories, and a user interface tier for visualizing, exploring and invoking analytics on the data. The platform has been used to integrate a collection of previously disparate steps to optimize the process parameters used to build a new additive material, enabling materials scientists and other non-software experts to capture, visualize and analyze the requisite data through a single user interface.",

      "abstract": "The amount of information needed to acquire knowledge on today's acquisition systems is growing exponentially due to more complex, higher resolution, software-intensive acquisition systems that need to operate in System-of-Systems (SoS), Family-of-Systems (FoS), Joint, and Coalition environments. Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle.",

      "abstract": "Web application technologies are growing rapidly with continuous innovation and improvements. This paper focuses on the popular Spring Boot [1] java-based framework for building web and enterprise applications and how it provides the flexibility for service-oriented architecture (SOA). One challenge with any Spring-based applications is its level of complexity with configurations. Spring Boot makes it easy to create and deploy stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with very little Spring configuration. Example, if we consider Spring Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework [2], we need to configure dispatcher servlet, web jars, a view resolver, and component scan among other things. To solve this, Spring Boot provides several Auto Configuration options to setup the application with any needed dependencies. Another challenge is to identify the framework dependencies and associated library versions required to develop a web application. Spring Boot offers simpler dependency management by using a comprehensive, but flexible, framework and the associated libraries in one single dependency, which provides all the Spring related technology that you need for starter projects as compared to CRUD web applications. This framework provides a range of additional features that are common across many projects such as embedded server, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration. Web applications are generally packaged as war and deployed to a web server, but Spring Boot application can be packaged either as war or jar file, which allows to run the application without the need to install and/or configure on the application server. In this paper, we discuss how Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Data Center (ADC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is using Spring Boot to create a SOA based REST [4] service API, that bridges the gap between frontend user interfaces and backend database. Using this REST service API, ARM scientists are now able to submit reports via a user form or a command line interface, which captures the same data quality or other important information about ARM data.",

The proposed framework can be viewed as an alternative to classical approaches where the privacy of big data is ensured via security-inspired protocols that check several (protocol) layers in order to achieve the desired privacy. Unfortunately, this injects considerable computational overheads in the overall process, thus introducing relevant challenges to be considered. Our approach instead tries to recognize the \"pedigree\" of suitable summary data representatives computed on top of the target big data repositories, hence avoiding computational overheads due to protocol checking. We also provide a relevant realization of the framework above, the so-called Data-dRIven aggregate-PROvenance privacypreserving big Multidimensional data (DRIPROM) framework, which specifically considers multidimensional data as the case of interest.",

In big data exchange, multiple entities exchange big datasets beyond the common data integration or data sharing paradigms, mostly in the context of data federation architectures. How to make big data exchange while ensuring privacy preservation constraintsƒ The latter is a critical research challenge that is gaining momentum on the research community, especially due to the wide family of application scenarios where it plays a critical role (e.g., social networks, bio-informatics tools, smart cities systems and applications, and so forth). Inspired by these considerations, in this paper we provide an overview of models and issues in the context of privacy-preserving big data exchange research, along with a selection of future research directions that will play a critical role in next-generation research.",

The analysis of this vast amount of data creates new opportunities to deliver modern personalized health and social care services. Big Data Analytics and underlying technologies have the potential to process and analyze these data to extract meaningful insights for improving quality of care, efficiency and sustainability of health and social care systems. Health organizations face therefore a new scenario where analytical tools must accommodate both traditional business intelligence and Big Data approaches, resulting in important technological and methodological challenges to be tackled. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to address the introduction of Big Data Analytics technologies into an integrated care provider.",

The value of the discovered knowledge from big data could be of greater value if it is available for later consumption and reusing. In this paper, we present an infrastructure that allows non-expert users to (i) apply user-friendly data mining techniques on big data sources, and (ii) share results as Linked Open Data (LOD). The main contribution of this paper is an approach for democratizing big data through reusing the knowledge gained from data mining processes after being semantically annotated as LOD, then obtaining Linked Open Knowledge. Our work is based on a model-driven viewpoint in order to easily deal with the wide diversity of open data formats.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet, the application of big data is more and more extensive. Compared with traditional marketing, big data marketing has significant advantages in market information acquisition, data processing and analysis, and data application. For the automotive industry, the traditional marketing mode is facing severe challenges due to the development of big data technology. In view of this form, a new marketing mode based on big data marketing, which is called precision marketing, came into being. The new automobile precision marketing mode based on big data can be implemented from the following aspects: precise positioning based on big data analysis, accurate push based on big data mining, and fine management based on big data application.",

In cluster computing, data partitioning and sampling are two fundamental strategies to speed up the computation of big data and increase scalability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the methods and techniques of data partitioning and sampling with respect to big data processing and analysis. We start with an overview of the mainstream big data frameworks on Hadoop clusters. The basic methods of data partitioning are then discussed including three classical horizontal partitioning schemes: range, hash, and random partitioning. Data partitioning on Hadoop clusters is also discussed with a summary of new strategies for big data partitioning, including the new Random Sample Partition (RSP) distributed model. The classical methods of data sampling are then investigated, including simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and reservoir sampling. Two common methods of big data sampling on computing clusters are also discussed: record-level sampling and block-level sampling. Record-level sampling is not as efficient as block-level sampling on big distributed data. On the other hand, block-level sampling on data blocks generated with the classical data partitioning methods does not necessarily produce good representative samples for approximate computing of big data. In this survey, we also summarize the prevailing strategies and related work on sampling-based approximation on Hadoop clusters. We believe that data partitioning and sampling should be considered together to build approximate cluster computing frameworks that are reliable in both the computational and statistical respects.",

      "abstract": "Seeing (surveillance) but not understanding (poor security performance)\" is common problem in most security systems. Although in recent years significant progress has been achieved in biometric identification technology, the progress of single technologies does not dramatically improve the overall performance or solve the system-level problems of social security. Currently in addition to improvements of single technology, the following system-level technical bottlenecks must be solved to improve the overall performance of social security: 1. Blind spots of perception exist in surveillance area of due to the non-overlap of surveillance sensors, 2. The performance of single identification technology decreases sharply in complex surveillance scenarios such as poor lighting conditions or disguise, 3. Traditional warning technologies become invalid due to the multi-stage non-stationary evolution feature of complex events. Three challenges listed above closely relate to three scientific problems in the analysis technology of big visual data on three levels: sensing data, identification technology and pattern recognition. Our study aims at (1) exploiting the complete mapping mechanism between physical space and multivariate sensing spaces to fill-in the blind spots of sensing data, (2) exploring the correlative mechanism of multi-modal objects in multivariate sensing spaces to improve the analytical performance from single identification technology, (3) studying the spatial-temporal evolution mechanism in the entire lifecycle of complex events to extend pattern recognition from local space and time. The security space is the physical space with comprehensive protective ability, which includes ubiquitous sensing, reliable identification, penetrating trend analysis and approaching danger warning at any time, at any location, for any object and for any behavior. Aiming to build the theory of security space, this study is divided into three levels: information acquisition and perceptional computation, scene analysis and evolution prediction, resource scheduling and system applications. Then it is further divided into five tasks: (1) task 1: visual object recognition and big data based identification, (2) task 2: situational awareness of groups and multi-scale revolution, (3) task 3: semantic analysis of scenes and correlative computation in multivariate spaces, (4) task 4: big scale visual retrieval and security risk analysis, (5) task 5: Warning system of the security space and its applications. Task 1 corresponds to the first level because sensing and identification of objects is the basis for analysis. Task 2 and 3 correspond to the second level since group behavior, events, scene and their evolution are crucial for the prediction and warning of security events. Task 4 and 5 correspond to the third level of this study in order to develop the high performance computing platform, to conduct system evaluation and application demonstration. Big visual data contains massive high-dimensional sensing data, implying the complicated relationship among social objects. In fact, in the world of data, the spatial-temporal relationship between the big data objects is more essential than the causal relationship, and these private and implicit relationships compose the core values of the big data social analysis. Only the analysis of individuals, groups and scenes in big visual data are based on the core element of social security analysis, that is\" social structure and social activities\", can it supports the strategic transference of urban security system from investigation afterwards to warning in advance. The overall purpose of this study is to build the big data analysis system in security space, realizing the intelligent big visual data system which supports data analysis of hundred billions of feature data, billions of image data, millions of visual sensing terminals. The expected achievements on the warning and protection system for large spaces can reach the international leading level. Based on the achievements above, the project plans to develop 10 intelligent big data analysis products of 3 categories, and the expected benefits of industrialization promotion can reach 100 billion, which promotes the upstream and downstream industry to realize economic benefits 3 billion. Also we strive to become the internationally leading industry in the field of big security data analysis.",

      "abstract": "In the current technological era, huge amounts of big data are generated and collected from a wide variety of rich data sources. These big data can be of different levels of veracity in the sense that some of them are precise while some others are imprecise and uncertain. Embedded in these big data are useful information and valuable knowledge to be discovered. An example of these big data is healthcare and epidemiological data such as data related to patients who suffered from epidemic diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Knowledge discovered from these epidemiological data-via data science techniques such as machine learning, data mining, and online analytical processing (OLAP)-helps researchers, epidemiologists and policy makers to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to come up ways to detect, control and combat the disease. In this paper, we present a machine learning and big data analytic tool for processing and analyzing COVID-19 epidemiological data. Specifically, the tool makes good use of taxonomy and OLAP to generalize some specific attributes into some generalized attributes for effective big data analytics. Instead of ignoring unknown or unstated values of some attributes, the tool provides users with flexibility of including or excluding these values, depending on their preference and applications. Moreover, the tool discovers frequent patterns and their related patterns, which help reveal some useful knowledge such as absolute and relative frequency of the patterns. Furthermore, the tool learns from the patterns discovered from historical data and predicts useful information such as clinical outcomes for future data. As such, the tool helps users to get a better understanding of information about the confirmed cases of COVID-19. Although this tool is designed for machine learning and analytics of big epidemiological data, it would be applicable to machine learning and analytics of big data in many other real-life applications and services.",

Efforts were geared towards extracting highly valuable insights that cannot happen if data is of poor quality. Therefore, data quality (DQ) is considered as a key element in Big data processing phase. In this stage, low quality data is not penetrated to the Big Data value chain. This paper, addresses the data quality rules discovery (DQR) after the evaluation of quality and prior to Big Data pre-processing. We propose a DQR discovery model to enhance and accurately target the pre-processing activities based on quality requirements. We defined, a set of pre-processing activities associated with data quality dimensions (DQD's) to automatize the DQR generation process. Rules optimization are applied on validated rules to avoid multi-passes pre-processing activities and eliminates duplicate rules. Conducted experiments showed an increased quality scores after applying the discovered and optimized DQR's on data.",

In this paper, we propose the Random Sample Partition (RSP) distributed data model to represent a big data set as a set of disjoint data blocks, called RSP blocks. Each RSP block has a probability distribution similar to that of the entire data set. RSP blocks can be used to estimate the statistical properties of the data and build predictive models without computing the entire data set. We demonstrate the implications of the RSP model on sampling from big data and introduce a new RSP-based method for approximate big data analysis which can be applied to different scenarios in the industry. This method significantly reduces the computational burden of big data and increases the productivity of data scientists.",

The paper is work in progress and provides a first view on Gartner’s Logical Data Warehouse paradigm, Data Fabric and Dehghani’s Data Mesh proposal as well as their interdependencies. It furthermore sketches the way forward how this work can be extended by covering more architecture paradigms (incl. classic Data Warehouse, Data Vault, Data Lake, Lambda and Kappa architectures) and introducing a template with among others \"context\", \"problem\" and \"solution\" descriptions, leading ultimately to a pattern system providing guidance for choosing the right architecture paradigm for the right situation",

This condition makes them difficult to apply on large and low-quality datasets. To handle the volume issue of big data, we develop the sampling algorithms to obtain a small representative training set. We design the fault-tolerant rule discovery and conflict-resolution algorithms to address the low-quality issue of big data. We also propose parameter selection strategy to ensure the effectiveness of CFD discovery algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can discover effective CFD rules on billion-tuple data within a reasonable period.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, Apache Spark has become the de facto standard for big data processing. SparkSQL is a module offering support for relational analysis on Spark with Structured Query Language (SQL). SparkSQL provides convenient data processing interfaces. Despite its efficient optimizer, SparkSQL still suffers from the inefficiency of Spark resulting from Java virtual machine and the unnecessary data serialization and deserialization. Adopting native languages such as C++ could help to avoid such bottlenecks. Benefiting from a bare-metal runtime environment and template usage, systems with C++ interfaces usually achieve superior performance. However, the complexity of native languages also increases the required programming and debugging efforts. In this work, we present LotusSQL, an engine to provide SQL support for dataset abstraction on a native backend Lotus. We employ a convenient SQL processing framework to deal with frontend jobs. Advanced query optimization technologies are added to improve the quality of execution plans. Above the storage design and user interface of the compute engine, LotusSQL implements a set of structured dataset operations with high efficiency and integrates them with the frontend. Evaluation results show that LotusSQL achieves a speedup of up to 9× in certain queries and outperforms Spark SQL in a standard query benchmark by more than 2× on average.",

      "abstract": "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) publishes Medicare Part C Star Ratings each year to measure the quality of care of Medicare Advantage (MA) contracts. One of the key measures is Complaints about the Health Plan, which is captured in Complaints Tracking Module (CTM). Complaints resulted in CTM are rare events: for MA contracts with 2-5 star ratings, number of complaints for every 1,000 members range from .10 to 1.84 over last 5 years. Reducing number of complaints is extremely important to MA plans as they impact CMS reimbursements to MA plans. Forecasting and reducing complaints is an extremely technically challenging task, and involves ethics considerations in patients' rights and privacy. In this research, we constructed a big data analytics framework for forecasting rare customer complaints. First, we built a big data ingestion pipelines on a Hadoop platform: a) Ingest MA plan's customer complaints data from CTM from past 3 years. b) Ingest health plan's call center data for MA members from past 3 years, including both structured data and unstructured text script for the calls. c) Ingest MA members' medical claims, including members' demographics and enrollment history. d) Ingest MA members' pharmacy claims. e) Integrate and unified data from above sources, and enrich the data with additional engineered features into a big wide table, one row per member for analysis and modeling. Second, we designed a unique decision tree based Large Ensemble with Over-Sampling (LEOS) algorithm, which mimics random forest but with extreme oversampling of target class to increase bias, and leverages the parallel computing of Hadoop clusters by generating thousands of fixed size training data sets, and for each such dataset training a decision trees with similar fixed tree structure, and ensemble them. Third, we validated our framework and LEOS learning algorithm with real data, and also discussed ethics issues we encountered in handling data and applying findings from research.",

      "abstract": "‘‘Knowledge is power” is an old adage that has been found to be true in today’s information age. Knowledge is derived from having access to information. The ability to gather information from large volumes of data has become an issue of relative importance. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is the term coined by researchers to describe the art of processing, storing and gathering large amounts of data for future examination. Data is being produced at an alarming rate. The rapid growth of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) and other technological advances are the main culprits behind this sustained growth. The data generated is a reflection of the environment it is produced out of, thus we can use the data we get out of systems to figure out the inner workings of that system. This has become an important feature in cybersecurity where the goal is to protect assets. Furthermore, the growing value of data has made big data a high value target. In this paper, we explore recent research works in cybersecurity in relation to big data. We highlight how big data is protected and how big data can also be used as a tool for cybersecurity. We summarize recent works in the form of tables and have presented trends, open research challenges and problems. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of cybersecurity in the big data era, as well as research trends and open challenges in this active research area.",

Clear the purpose of big data analysis, build data analysis system, describe the process of data analysis. There are four steps in big data analysis: data acquisition, data storage, data analysis and data mining. Data acquisition can be divided into two parts: acquisition and preprocessing, which is just narrow data acquisition. The data analysis of the Internet of things is a process of organizing and purposefully collecting data, processing data and analyzing data to form information. The analysis process is the support and execution process of the algorithm. In the data processing cycle, data analysis should be used properly in every link from data acquisition in the field perception layer to data transmission in the communication layer to data processing in the application layer, so as to improve the effectiveness and rationality of data processing.",

The data transfer is increasingly frequent and speedy, and the data lifecycle is also extended, bringing more challenges to security and privacy risk governance. Currently, the common measures of risk governance covering the entire data life cycle are the data-related staff management, equipment security management, data encryption codes, data content identification and de-identification processing, etc. With the trend of data globalization, regulations fragmentation and governance technologization, “International standards”, a measure of governance combining technology and regulation, has the potential to become the best practice. However, “voluntary compliance” of international standards derogates the effectiveness of risk governance through this measure. In order to strengthen the enforcement of the international standards, the paper proposes a governance approach which is “the framework regulated by international standards, and regulations and technologies specifically implemented by national legislation.” It aims to implement the security and privacy risk governance of Big Data effectively.",

It also introduces hadoop, the open source software for big data, and shows how to download, set up, and use hadoop software on Raspberry Pi. Java, as a modern high‐level programming language, is well suited for big data applications. Several sources are generating big data which includes social media web sites, e‐commerce web sites, telecommunication companies, stock market, internet of things, hospitals, banks, weather stations, and government departments. Big data is really one of the most important emerging digital technologies in the modern world. Hadoop distributed file system provides data storage. It is designed to run on low‐cost hardware with high fault tolerance. MapReduce provides data processing. It is a software framework written in Java that can be used to create applications for processing large amounts of data.",

The project mainly consists of three modules: network module, UPS module and visualisation. The network module uses Raspberry Pi as a platform to build an OpenWRT system, and also carries a 4G module for network emergency response, while the UPS module applies mainstream SPWM modulation technology to make the UPS more digital. and decision-making. Through practical application, the UPS module can be used in a variety of scenarios to achieve the functions required for timely supply in the event of either a power failure or a network failure, providing a strong guarantee for users' work and study after a power failure.",

This paper considers that the analysis system of city price should include decision-making layer, supporting layer and showing layer on the conceptual level, and its transmission path should include the data collection, data management, data mining, decision making and safety protection. when it comes to the construction of the subsystem, technological tools such as data mining, cloud computing and visualization should be used, mainly in order to build data acquisition subsystem, data management subsystem, data analysis subsystem, data transmission subsystem and so on, and provide the graphic description for the corresponding technological path at the same time.",

      "abstract": "The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).",

In the big data technology system, big data collection is the basis. The storage, analysis, integration and visualization of unstructured data and semi-structured data will become an important focus of the big data innovation. Traditional structured data will no longer be the core of big data. Based on the life cycle theory, using new digital technology, such as acquisition, processing, storage, organization and copyright protection, clusters of high concurrency retrieval and dynamic scheduling, intelligent digital display, coal mine industry information data can be collected and integrated, to realize centralized management, unified retrieval and joint exhibition of information resources, to provide technical means and reference for the digital construction of heterogeneous coal mine information data by means of big data thinking.",

Data science results depend upon the quality of data been extracted. The objective of this research paper is to implement a federated query processing framework which extracts data from different data sources and stores the result datasets in a common in-memory data format. This helps data scientists to perform their analysis and execute machine learning algorithms using different data engines without having to convert the data into their native data format and improve the performance.",

Analysis showed major research themes related to big data were hadoop, method, analysis, cloud, social, mobile, privacy, health and policy, and we confirmed that these researches are mutually circulated through policy and social. As a result of analyzing the characteristics of each research theme from the point of view of public goods, and structuring it with three criteria of data structure, policy tool and market regulation, an ecosystem that can be managed politically is being constructed by organizing service market based on big data technology and utilizing contents. In order to revitalize the big data market, it is absolutely necessary to participate not only in the technology and service market, but also in the policy makers and data curators at business sector. Therefore, it is necessary to make effort to invest, utilize and manage about big data industry with the perspective of public policy.",

This, coupled with the complex nature of Big Data, is the cause that many Big Data projects fail or rarely obtain the expected return of investment. In this paper, we present a methodology to tackle Big Data projects in a systematic way, avoiding the aforementioned problems. To this end, we review the state of the art, identifying the most prominent problems surrounding Big Data projects, best practices and methods. Then, we define a methodology describing step by step how these techniques could be applied and combined in order to tackle the problems identified and increase the success rate of Big Data projects.",

      "abstract": "A key takeaway from the COVID-19 crisis is the need for scalable methods and systems for ingestion of big data related to the disease, such as models of the virus, health surveys, and social data, and the ability to integrate and analyze the ingested data rapidly. One specific example is the use of the Internet of Things and wearables (i.e., the Oura ring) to collect large-scale individualized data (e.g., temperature and heart rate) continuously and to create personalized baselines for detection of disease symptoms. Individualized data, when collected, has great potential to be linked with other datasets making it possible to combine individual and societal scale models for further understanding the disease. However, the volume and variability of such data require novel big data approaches to be developed as infrastructure for scalable use. This paper presents the data pipeline and big data infrastructure for the TemPredict project, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest public effort to gather continuous physiological data for time-series analysis. This effort unifies data ingestion with the development of a novel end-to-end cyberinfrastructure to enable the curation, cleaning, alignment, sketching, and passing of the data, in a secure manner, by the researchers making use of the ingested data for their COVID-19 detection algorithm development efforts. We present the challenges, the closed-loop data pipelines, and the secure infrastructure to support the development of time-sensitive algorithms for alerting individuals based on physiological predictors illness, enabling early intervention.",

      "abstract": "After a disaster such as earthquakes, debris flows, forest fires, or landslides, etc., a lot of people have to be away from their home and gather in a shelter. In addition, the refugees suffer from the shortage of necessary resources due to impaired life infrastructure, such as damaged roads and communication networks. The degree of reducing damage depends on the amount of food, water, daily necessities and communication resources required by each shelter. How to effectively and efficiently allocate resources according to grasp the exact need of a disaster situation will be an important issue. We estimate the degree of the disaster by collecting and analyzing big data from the SNS, and building a platform for the communication resources to be efficiently and effectively allocated. In order to achieve this goal, we are challenging the following issues A) Understanding situations (user requirements) after disaster occur The SNS streams large scale semantic information about real time situation in society, especially during and after disaster. It is both domain-specific and computational challenge in processing the heterogeneous large data set to extract the exact situational content with reduced semantic uncertainty. The machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NPL) tool kits are useful in semantic analysis, but still needs domain-specific implementation and computational improvement for the situation understanding from the SNS big data. B) Understanding distribution patterns of situations/users' requirements The disaster related situation is spatiotemporally correlated, and varies dynamically in space and time. It is also domain-specific and computational challenge in estimating the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the disaster affect based on the spatial big data from SNS. The scan statistics such as the spatial scan have provided well tested mathematical tools and software for spatial data mining. However, new methodologies are necessary since the assumptions have to be different when it meets the spatial big data in SNS. And the computational complexity in spatial big data is also a bottleneck for real-time processing. C) Solving uncertainty of big crowd data One of the major features in big crowd data, e.g., SNS data, is uncertainty behind the data. Especially in a disaster scenario, the collecting time period cannot be long enough to smooth the data automatically. How to efficiently solve uncertainty problem in the big crowd data in a disaster scenario becomes a new and big challenge for disaster management.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, big data lakes are prominent components of emerging big data architectures. Basically, big data lakes are the natural evolution of data warehousing systems in the big data context, and deal with several requirements deriving from the well-known 3V nature of big data. Along with the emerging of big data lake research initiative, several issues appeared, such as: (i) big data lake models; (ii) big data lake frameworks; (iii) big data lake techniques. In line with this exciting research perspective, this paper proposes an overview of state-of-the-art approaches that are at the foundations of big data lake research, and innovative open problems and issues, which drive future research directions, on advancing the big data lake research trend.",

      "abstract": "Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is currently the fastest growing sector of enterprise software, estimated to increase to $36.5B worldwide by 2017. CRM technologies increasingly use data mining primitives across multiple applications. At the same time, the growth of big data has led to the evolution of an open source big data software stack (primarily powered by Apache software) that rivals traditional enterprise database (RDBMS) stacks. New technologies such as Kafka, Storm, HBase have significantly enriched this open source stack, alongside more established technologies such as Hadoop MapReduce and Mahout. Today, enterprises have a choice to make regarding which stack they will choose to power their big data applications. However, there are no published studies in literature on enterprise big data pipelines built using open source components supporting CRM. Specific questions that enterprises have include: how is the data processed and analyzed in such pipelines? What are the building blocks of such pipelines? How long does each step of this processing take? In this work, we answer these questions for a large scale (serving over a 100M customers) industrial CRM pipeline that incorporates data mining, and serves several applications. Our pipeline has, broadly, two parts. The first is a data gathering part that uses Kafka, Storm, and HBase. The second is a data mining part that uses Mahout and Hadoop MapReduce. We also provide timings for common tasks in the second part such as data preprocessing for machine learning, clustering, reservoir sampling, and frequent itemset extraction.",

Among them, the development of big data technology and cloud computing technology is very rapid, and these technologies are of great help to improving the efficiency of data storage and management. However, the data system itself has certain data security problems in the big data cloud computing environment. In order to improve people's information security in the process of data processing and integration, we need to study data security protection technology in the big data cloud computing environment. Only in this way can we solve data and information security issues based on specific conditions and improve the reliability and security of data transmission.",

      "abstract": "Perl is one of the most important programming languages in many research areas. However, the most relevant Big Data frameworks, Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and Apache Storm, do not support natively this language. To take advantage of these Big Data engines Perl programmers should port their applications to Java or Scala, which requires a huge effort, or use utilities as Hadoop Streaming with the corresponding degradation in the performance. For this reason we introduce Perldoop2, a Big Data-oriented Perl-Java source-to-source compiler. The compiler is able to generate Java code from Perl applications for sequential execution, but also for running on clusters taking advantage of Hadoop, Spark and Storm engines. Perl programmers only need to tag the source code in order to use the compiler. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of Perldoop2 in terms of ease of use, performance and scalability.",

      "abstract": "Big data is a broad data set that has been used in many fields. To process huge data set is a time consuming work, not only due to its big volume of data size, but also because data type and structure can be different and complex. Currently, many data mining and machine learning technique are being applied to deal with big data problem; some of them can construct a good learning algorithm in terms of lots of training example. However, considering the data dimension, it will be more efficient if learning algorithm is capable of selecting useful features or decreasing the feature dimension. Word2Vec, proposed and supported by Google, is not an individual algorithm, but it consists of two learning models, Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. By feeding text data into one of learning models, Word2Vec outputs word vectors that can be represented as a large piece of text or even the entire article. In our work, we first training the data via Word2Vec model and evaluated the word similarity. In addition, we clustering the similar words together and use the generated clusters to fit into a new data dimension so that the data dimension is decreased.",

It not only needs a large calculation space, but also has poor data cleaning effect. To solve the above problems, a smart grid big data cleaning model based on tensor Tucker decomposition is proposed. KNN algorithm is used to detect abnormal data in power grid big data, and the missing data is filled and removed. The tensor Tucker decomposition is used to compress the data and reduce the data dimension. Based on the neural network structure, the data cleaning model is constructed. Compared with the traditional model, the average effective cleaning rate of the cleaning model after tensor Tucker decomposition is 94.16%, which has good data cleaning effect.",

Big-data research is being carried out for a long time to extract the data from larger datasets. Generally, some of the devices, sensors generate a humongous amount of data continuously. Hence performing any computational operation or search operation in that bulk data is remaining as a challenging task. At present, the big data researchers are facing challenges such as duplication of data, and identifying the data from one data set to others and also identifying the multidisciplinary data is also a challenging task. When the data is increasing tremendously day by day as a result the server size, capacity and device storage size, RAM etc., should also be improved for deploying fast and efficient results. In this research work, the Big Data Analytics Problem (BDAP) is proposed for offering many solutions such as data deduplication, security, reliability access control etc., and finally and most important it is used for making analysis and decision making.",

      "abstract": "In August 2015, a new seafloor observatory was deployed in Galway Bay, Ireland. The sensors on the observatory platform are connected by fibre-optic cable to a shore station, where a broadband connection allows data transfer to the Marine Institute's data centre. This setup involved the development of a new data acquisition system which takes advantage of open source streaming data solutions developed in response to the Big Data paradigm, in particular the Velocity aspect. This activity merges concepts from the arenas of both Big Data and Internet of Things where data standardisation is not normally considered. This paper considers the architecture implemented to stream marine data from instrument to end user and offers suggestions on how to standardise these data streams.",

To make use of this data effectively, efficient techniques for collecting, storing and managing data are needed. In this paper, we present a health big data indexing technique that allows for the efficient storage, querying and management of tele-rehabilitation related big data collected via health sensors connected to client machines accessing web-based e-Health frameworks. Our novel scheme is based on indexing of rehabilitation data based on the human body joint model. We further index the data based on other parameters that may be of interest to researchers such as ethnicity and geographical location. We have described all components of the system in brief.",

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a design scheme of a visual analysis platform for real estate market monitoring. First, carry out conceptual analysis and feature induction of spatio-temporal big data to realize the collection processing and organizational structure analysis of real estate spatio-temporal big data. Then a four-tier platform architecture consisting of data sources layer, data resource management layer, interface service engine layer and visual application layer is designed. The visualization platform designed by this scheme has good scalability, and can provide technical guidance for the construction of a visualization analysis platform in the field of industry spatio-temporal big data. Finally, a visual application design is carried out based on the real estate market data of Hubei Province, which proves the validity and feasibility of the research scheme in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Advances in healthcare data management and analytics have opened new horizons for healthcare providers such as cost effective treatments, ability to detect medical fraud, and diagnose diseases at an early stage. Central to these abilities is the need for fast ad-hoc query processing of large volumes of complex healthcare datasets. End users who work with healthcare databases spend enormous effort in data exploration since exploration is the first step to any subsequent predictive modeling to generate actionable insights for patients, providers and physicians. Unfortunately, unlike other domains the complexity and volumes of claims (ICD9 or 10) as well as clinical (HL7) healthcare datasets results in data exploration solutions being extremely slow and cumbersome when attempted using traditional disk resident data warehousing approaches. In this paper we describe the first ever attempt of real-time data exploration for healthcare datasets using in-memory databases. We benchmark and compare two such in-memory database systems to study responsiveness and ability to handle complexity of typical health data exploration tasks. We share our work in progress results and outline key issues that need to be addressed for forthcoming advances in this very important big data vertical.",

The capability to process these gigantic amounts of data in real-time with Big Data Analytics (BDA) tools and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms carries many paybacks. However, the high number of free BDA tools, platforms, and data mining tools makes it challenging to select the appropriate one for the right task. This paper presents a comprehensive mini-literature review of ML in BDA, using a keyword search; a total of 1512 published articles was identified. The articles were screened to 140 based on the study proposed novel taxonomy. The study outcome shows that deep neural networks (15%), support vector machines (15%), artificial neural networks (14%), decision trees (12%), and ensemble learning techniques (11%) are widely applied in BDA. The related applications fields, challenges, and most importantly the openings for future research, are detailed.",

While BDA has improved efficiency and created business value, leading to growing interest from businesses and organisations in investing in such technologies, there are some growing concerns about the secure and lawful processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper, we briefly describe our ongoing research that addresses these concerns that could ultimately lead to the development of an improved DPIA methodology capable of assessing data protection risks based on BDA technologies.",

The collection and analysis technology of big data has opened up a new path for social risk management. Big data technology provides powerful data information, tool capabilities and technical platform support for social risk governance. With the application of big data collection and analysis technology, the subject participation governance model has been tried, the traditional social governance model has changed, and the social risk governance has become more scientific. In the new era, social risk management should be promoted by big data acquisition and analysis technology. It is necessary to cultivate big data thinking and change the thinking paradigm of social risk management; Optimizing the institutional system and coordinating the effectiveness of social risk management; Actively participate in various parties to realize diversified and coordinated governance of social risks.",

      "abstract": "Simulation has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to mimic processes and activities in emergency departments. However, most applications only rely on the data that were manually input by the staff in the departments. First, this practice does not guarantee that the required data to build the simulation models are captured in the computer system, as some information about the processes of emergency departments are not electronically stored. Second, human errors and missing data are also common for manual inputs. A simulation model that is incapable of representing the actual system of the emergency department will deliver wrong conclusions to hospital administrators and may lead to negative consequences if they trust the simulation results. In this paper, we present a case study of developing a simulation model of an emergency department in Hong Kong and discuss the data challenges. Then we propose an RFID-enabled infrastructure to automatically capture large volumes of data regarding the patient activities in the ED in order to build simulation models of more details and a higher accuracy.",

The prime contribution of the proposed system is to perform enough processing over the raw and unstructured distributed data from multiple locations so that processing over distributed storage and mining can be done with lesser processing time and higher degree of accuracy. An experimental research methodology has been adopted to capture signal using Logitech HD C920 and processed over Intel Xeon E5540 processors with 2 GPbs connectivity. The raw data is subjected to pre-processing, segmentation, scene profiling, in order to get convolved data that are stored in distributive manner using Hadoop and mined using MapReduce. The comparative study outcome shows lesser processing time and higher accuracy as compared to existing relevant analytics.",

      "abstract": "By studying the international advanced practices of government integrity evaluation represented by Standard & Poor's, Global Integrity, Transparency International and Korea, this paper found that most of the evaluations are based on perceptual surveys. Although this method of data acquisition is simple and easy to implement, it has inherent defects, such as strong subjectivity, lack of details, prone to cause sample deviation, etc. Based on the goal of improving government capacity in integrity, this paper put forward a new idea of government integrity evaluation based on big data: Firstly, collect the behavior data and complaint reporting data in the government business systems, combine with the public opinion data on the Internet. Then, use the big data technology to get the evaluation indicator data of government integrity. Finally, construct a scientific evaluation model through the credit scorecard method. Compared with the traditional measure of evaluation, the government integrity evaluation based on big data in this paper not only can obtain more accurate evaluation results, but also has great value in its evaluation process. A large amount of objective and quantitative - rather than subjective and perceived data - can better support government decision-making and reform. The scientific evaluation indicator system can also guide the specific work of the government.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of Big Data technologies, organizations can efficiently store and analyze more data than ever before. However, extracting maximal value from this data can be challenging for many reasons. For example, datasets are often not stored using human-understandable terms, making it difficult for a large set of users to benefit from them. Further, given that different types of data may be best stored using different technologies, datasets that are closely related may be stored separately with no explicit linkage. Finally, even within individual data stores, there are often inconsistencies in data representations, whether introduced over time or due to different data producers. These challenges are further compounded by frequent additions to the data, including new raw data as well as results produced by large-scale analytics. Thus, even within a single Big Data environment, it is often the case that multiple rich datasets exist without the means to access them in a unified and cohesive way, often leading to lost value. This paper describes the development of a Big Data management infrastructure with semantic technologies at its core to provide a unified data access layer and a consistent approach to analytic execution. Semantic technologies were used to create domain models describing mutually relevant datasets and the relationships between them, with a graphical user interface to transparently query across datasets using domain-model terms. This prototype system was built for GE Power & Water's Power Generation Products Engineering Division, which has produced over 50TB of gas turbine and component prototype test data to date. The system is expected to result in significant savings in productivity and expenditure.",

      "abstract": "Remote sensing data has grown explosively in the past decade. However, remote sensing application systems evolve slowly due to the challenges on big imagery data storage and processing. The cost of accessing current remote sensing images is still very high. The learning curve of using remote sensing images and image processing tools is still steep. The response to emergencies is not fast enough. The development of big data and cloud computing technologies in recent years has brought new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing application. The remote sensing business model based on web and cloud computing environment is a clear trend. This paper gives a brief overview on the challenges faced during building big imagery analytics system for remote sensing, and proposes a cloud computing solution for big imagery data analytics. Experimental results of cloud computing with space, traditional film, and UAV images are also presented in this paper. It is a full stack solution based on ArcGIS platform for remote sensing imagery storage, management, processing and application, which can be an ideal platform for the next generation remote sensing application business model.",

Using an SSD as a cache for accesses to HDDs is one of the promising methods for improving large-scale I/O performance in modern computers. In addition, M.2 is increasing its importance in high-performance I/O processing. In this paper, we investigate the I/O performance of storage systems including M.2 SSD and SSD cache. Our experimental results show that big-data processing performance can improve significantly by using an M.2 SSD cache.",

Big data can discover deep-seated rules and connections of data through valuable data processing. Big data investigation is different from the traditional reconstructing criminal process by consequence traceability. It is a process of mining effective clues on the basis of analyzing and dealing with the links between various clues. It is an effective investigation model based on a large number of data, which can make certain prediction of the direction of investigation. This is a change for ex post investigation and passive investigation in the past. It will also change the single-thread investigation mode to multi-clue cooperative investigation, which will surely lead the future development direction of investigation.",

The analysis demonstrated that the big data paradigm commenced in late 2011 and the research production exponentially rose starting in 2012, which approximated a Weibull distribution that captured 82% of the variance (p<.01). We found there were 13 dominant topics capturing 49% of the big data production in journals during 2011–2016 but privacy and security topics accounted for only 2% and this trend recently dropped to less than 1% Thus, we argued that we need to stimulate more big data privacy-security research.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the RE practices and challenges in such projects, currently bereft in the scientific literature. This investigation was focused on: (a) RE practices; (b) sources and distribution of requirements; (c) the role of Big Data characteristics and technologies in RE and systems design; and (d) RE challenges in engineering Big Data Systems. The main results show that (a) there is a lack of specific project tailored RE practices, tools, and frameworks for elicitation, specification and modelling, analysis, and prioritisation of requirements; (b) 40% of the system's requirements are considered Big Data-related from which 75% are identified from internal sources; (c) Big Data characteristics and technologies play an important role in defining quality requirements and system's architecture; (d) five challenges in eliciting, documenting, and analysing Big Data related requirements were identified and discussed. The findings suggest academics and practitioners opportunities to engage in further research in this area.",

      "abstract": "Big Data contains massive information, which are generating from heterogeneous, autonomous sources with distributed and anonymous platforms. Since, it raises extreme challenge to organizations to store and process these data. Conventional pathway of store and process is happening as collection of manual steps and it is consuming various resources. An automated real-time and online analytical process is the most cognitive solution. Therefore it needs state of the art approach to overcome barriers and concerns currently facing by the Big Data industry. In this paper we proposed a novel architecture to automate data analytics process using Nested Automatic Service Composition (NASC) and CRoss Industry Standard Platform for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as main based technologies of the solution. NASC is well defined scalable technology to automate multi-disciplined problems domains. Since CRISP-DM also a well-known data science process which can be used as innovative accumulator of multi-dimensional data sets. CRISP-DM will be mapped with Big Data analytical process and NASC will automate the CRISP-DM process in an intelligent and innovative way.",

To effectively protect the valuable information within the organization, the following steps are needed: Employing a holistic approach for data classification, identifying sensitive data of the organization, Identifying critical exit points - communication channels, applications and connected devices and protecting the sensitive data by controlling the critical exit points. Our approach is based on creating of component-based architecture framework for ISS, conceptual models for data protection and implementation with COTS IT security products as Data Leak Prevention (DLP) solutions. Our approach is data centric, which is holistic by its nature to protect the meaningful data of the organization.",

Most of the time researchers and scientists have easy access to these data as well. However, the process of extracting and processing a large volume of data from several sources can be very time consuming and difficult. In most cases scientists rely on expensive proprietary software [1]. This paper discusses how Computational Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are extracting, normalizing, and processing millions of geospatial data points from multiple data sources and integrating them into a common data format which helps user to find and access these data using a flexible visualization-based user interface.",

      "abstract": "As it is difficult to directly share data among different organizations, data federation brings new opportunities to the data-related cooperation among different organizations by providing abstract data interfaces. With the development of Cloud computing, organizations store data on the Cloud to achieve elasticity and scalability for data processing. The existing data placement approaches generally only consider one aspect, which is either communication cost or time cost, and do not consider the features of jobs that process the data. In this paper, we propose an approach to enable secure data processing on the Cloud with the data from different organizations. The approach consists of a data federation platform for secure data processing on the Cloud named FedCube and a greedy data placement algorithm that creates a plan to store data on the Cloud in order to achieve multiple objectives based on a cost model. The cost model is composed of two objectives, i.e., reducing both monetary cost and execution time. We present an experimental evaluation by comparing our data placement algorithm with the existing methods based on the data federation platform. The experiments show that our proposed algorithm significantly reduce the total cost (up to 69.8%).",

Knowledge discovered from these epidemiological data via data science helps researchers, epidemiologists and policy makers to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to come up ways to detect, control and combat the disease. In this paper, we present a data science solution for analyzing big COVID-19 epidemiological data.

      "abstract": "Executing Big Data workloads upon High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastractures has become an attractive way to improve their performances. However, the collocation of HPC and Big Data workloads is not an easy task, mainly because of their core concepts' differences. This paper focuses on the challenges related to the scheduling of both Big Data and HPC workloads on the same computing platform. In classic HPC workloads, the rigidity of jobs tends to create holes in the schedule: we can use those idle resources as a dynamic pool for Big Data workloads. We propose a new idea based on Resource and Job Management System's (RJMS) configuration, that makes HPC and Big Data systems to communicate through a simple prolog/epilog mechanism. It leverages the built-in resilience of Big Data frameworks, while minimizing the disturbance on HPC workloads. We present the first study of this approach, using the production RJMS middleware OAR and Hadoop YARN from the HPC and Big Data ecosystems respectively. Our new technique is evaluated with real experiments upon the Grid5000 platform. Our experiments validate our assumptions and show promising results. The system is capable of running an HPC workload with 70% cluster utilization, with a Big Data workload that fills the schedule holes to reach a full 100% utilization. We observe a penalty on the mean waiting time for HPC jobs of less than 17% and a Big Data effectiveness of more than 68% in average.",

However, the technology is still in the primary stage, and there are still many deficiencies. Therefore, this paper proposes the core technology research of education big data based on data mining. This paper makes an in-depth investigation and Research on the current management mode of education big data. Through the survey, it is a mainstream trend to adopt data mining technology to manage education big data. However, due to the immature technology, there are still some technical defects in the existing management, such as inaccurate prediction and incomplete data collection. In view of these shortcomings, this paper proposes an optimization and improvement scheme, which adjusts the data normalization processing method, optimizes the data clustering method, improves the prediction accuracy and simplifies the calculation steps. In the related verification experiments, compared with the traditional random recommendation algorithm and collaborative filtering algorithm, the prediction accuracy of the improved scheme has been improved, reaching a high level of 99.2%. This paper analyzes that the education big data management scheme based on data mining will play an important role in the future education management.",

Therefore, big data technology is increasingly recognized by the public. While creating a lot of commercial value for enterprises, it also brings huge challenges to information security and privacy. In the big data environment, data has become an important medium for corporate decision-making, and information security and privacy protection have become the “army battleground” in corporate competition. Therefore, information security and privacy protection are getting more and more attention from enterprises, which also determines whether enterprises can occupy a place in the fiercely competitive market. This article analyzes the information security and privacy protection issues of enterprises in the big data environment from three aspects. Starting from the importance and significance of big data protection, it analyzes the security and privacy issues of big data in enterprise applications, and finally conducts information security and privacy protection for enterprises. Privacy protection puts forward relevant suggestions.",

      "abstract": "Many existing data mining algorithms search interesting patterns from transactional databases of precise data. However, there are situations in which data are uncertain. Items in each transaction of these probabilistic databases of uncertain data are usually associated with existential probabilities, which express the likelihood of these items to be present in the transaction. When compared with mining from precise data, the search space for mining from uncertain data is much larger due to the presence of the existential probabilities. This problem is worsened as we are moving to the era of Big data. Furthermore, in many real-life applications, users may be interested in a tiny portion of this large search space for Big data mining. Without providing opportunities for users to express the interesting patterns to be mined, many existing data mining algorithms return numerous patterns -- out of which only some are interesting. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that (i) allows users to express their interest in terms of constraints and (ii) uses the MapReduce model to mine uncertain Big data for frequent patterns that satisfy the user-specified constraints. By exploiting properties of the constraints, our algorithm greatly reduces the search space for Big data mining of uncertain data, and returns only those patterns that are interesting to the users for Big data analytics.",

      "abstract": "A USAF sponsored MITRE research team undertook four separate, domain-specific case studies about Big Data applications. Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the \"truth about Big Data\" is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another.",

As a result, the number of unstructured data projects are increased. However, several organizations are still lack of knowledge how to determine the unstructured data in the organization and exploit it. Therefore, the tool of extracting unstructured data is needed. This research aims to propose the framework to identify the unstructured usage in the organization. The framework has been derived from the interview of the experts in areas. After that, the framework has been used to verify the results. The success case and failed are also shown. This can be seen that the proposed framework can be used in the organization to help the user extract the unstructured data usage in the organization. It can help to make the decision related to unstructured data project.",

They allow the discovery of significant information from large data sets, otherwise, it is hidden. In this paper, an approach of robust Cloudera-Hadoop based data pipeline is proposed to perform analyses for any scale and type of data, in which selected US stocks are analysed to predict daily gains based on real time data from Yahoo Finance. The Apache Hadoop big-data framework is provided to handle large data sets through distributed storage and processing, stocks from the US stock market are picked and their daily gain data are divided into training and test data set to predict the stocks with high daily gains using Machine Learning module of Spark.",

The generation of a large amount of information data has laid the cornerstone for the application of big data analysis. How to effectively mine data resources, use big data analysis to guide oilfield production practices, and provide a theoretical basis for decision-making to improve quality and efficiency is the technology core. In recent years, Huabei Oilfield has explored the application of big data analysis in oil and gas production. According to the types and characteristics of oilfield data, it has proposed and created a closed-loop big data analysis “seven-step method” system from acquisition, processing, tracking, and evaluation, preliminary designed and developed a data mining platform for oil production engineering based on Hadoop/Spark; The platform has been applied in 6 oil and gas production units and achieved remarkable social and economic benefits.",

      "abstract": "An abundance of data in many disciplines of science, engineering, national security, health care, and business has led to the emerging field of Big Data Analytics that run in a cloud computing environment. To process massive quantities of data in the cloud, developers leverage Data-Intensive Scalable Computing (DISC) systems such as Google's MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark. Currently, developers do not have easy means to debug DISC applications. The use of cloud computing makes application development feel more like batch jobs and the nature of debugging is therefore post-mortem. Developers of big data applications write code that implements a data processing pipeline and test it on their local workstation with a small sample data, downloaded from a TB-scale data warehouse. They cross fingers and hope that the program works in the expensive production cloud. When a job fails or they get a suspicious result, data scientists spend hours guessing at the source of the error, digging through post-mortem logs. In such cases, the data scientists may want to pinpoint the root cause of errors by investigating a subset of corresponding input records. The vision of my work is to provide interactive, real-time and automated debugging services for big data processing programs in modern DISC systems with minimum performance impact. My work investigates the following research questions in the context of big data analytics: (1) What are the necessary debugging primitives for interactive big data processing? (2) What scalable fault localization algorithms are needed to help the user to localize and characterize the root causes of errors? (3) How can we improve testing efficiency during iterative development of DISC applications by reasoning the semantics of dataflow operators and user-defined functions used inside dataflow operators in tandem? To answer these questions, we synthesize and innovate ideas from software engineering, big data systems, and program analysis, and coordinate innovations across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.",

Research analysts have perceived an increase in data that contains both useful and useless entities. In extraction of useful information, data warehouse finds difficulties in enduring with increasing amount of data generated. With shifts in paradigm, big data analytics emerged as promising area of research which supports business intelligence in terms of decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on BigData, BigData problems, BigData Analytics and Big Data Warehouse. In addition, it also explains how the need for augmentation of big data and data warehouse emerged in perspective of decision making, comparing methods and research problems. It also elaborates applications which support Big Data, Data Warehouse, and its challenges.",

Therefore, based on the development situation of big data era, this paper establishes an innovation and entrepreneurship guidance service platform based on B/S architecture for the guidance service of innovation and entrepreneurship education system in application-oriented universities. The scheme mainly uses the advanced J2EE environment, and combined with big data to build a new model of innovation and entrepreneurship education system in application-oriented university. We also design and implement the key modules of the system combined with data sharing and Internet technology. The development process involves the storage application of Servlet, JavaBean, JSP, JavaScript and SQL technology. The system operation test results prove the feasibility of the scheme, which can effectively play the role of big data and improve the entrepreneurship rate of college graduates.",

However, most farmers have to collect water quality data manually at present, and cannot store and reuse that information rapidly. This paper aims to use SpringBoot framework and JPA framework to build a big data platform of acquisition automation and visualization, which realizes the data analysis and display of heterogeneous water quality and breeding information. The platform can make the water quality prediction and real-time warning. Meanwhile, it realizes the management of robots, users and breeding experts. The application of this platform will bring better social benefits to aquaculture farmers.",

One of the main challenges in this era of Big Data is how to efficiently manage and analyse such scale of data. This is challenging not only due to the size of the data, but also due to its heterogeneous nature and geographic location. In this sense, clouds are becoming an increasingly popular infrastructure for enabling large-scale data intensive scientific and business applications. Cloud provides a suitable environment for processing Big Data applications to process large volumes of data and parallel processing of data. Due to the geographical distribution of data different varieties of data it is of more advantage to use a federated Inter-Cloud environment where moving of large volumes of data can be avoided. Workflows are used to allocate and schedule execution of Big Data applications in an optimized manner. In this paper we present the need of execution of Big Data Application workflows on Cloud and Inter-Cloud environments.",

      "abstract": "As the volume of data grows rapidly, storing big data in a single data center is no longer feasible. Hence, companies have developed two scenarios to store their big data in multiple data centers. In the first scenario, the company's big data are distributed in multiple data centers without data replication. In the second scenario, data are also stored in multiple data centers but important data are replicated in these data centers to increase data safety and availability. However, in these scenarios, analyzing big data distributed in multiple data centers becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose two data distribution strategies to support big data analysis across geo-distributed data centers. In these strategies, we use the recent Random Sample Partition data model to convert big data into sets of random sample data blocks and distribute these data blocks into multiple data centers either without replication or with replication. In analyzing big data in multiple data centers without replication, we randomly select samples of data blocks from multiple data centers and download the sample data blocks to one data center for analysis. In the second strategy with replication of data blocks, we can analyze big data on any data center by randomly selecting a sample of data blocks replicated from other data centers. This strategy avoids data transformation between data centers. We demonstrate the performance of the two strategies in big data analysis by using simulation results produced on one local data center and four AWS data centers in North America, Asia, and Australia.",

As storage data volumes grow and the pace of change accelerates, it can be a struggle to keep up the integrity of a large scale storage network. Software Defined Networking (SDN) [5][6][7][8][10][11] provides a method to centrally conFigure and manage physical and virtual network devices such as routers, switches, and gateways in HPC datacenter. Current HPC computer cluster and data centers are using homogeneous data network technologies such as the Infiniband network (QDR, FDR, EDR, and HDR). Due to the connector, cable, and bandwidth backward compatibility issues, once an aged HPC computing system was retired, we have to demolish all established computer clusters, data network, and data storage. Eventually we lost all costly investment on the data network and storage. Those current deployment approaches do not provide a feasible and compatible growing path and cannot meet the need for future extreme scale HPC computing systems [4][12][13].",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, and particularly machine learning, has been used in many ways by the research community to turn a variety of diverse and even heterogeneous data sources into high quality facts and knowledge, providing premier capabilities to accurate pattern discovery. However, applying machine learning strategies on big and complex datasets is computationally expensive, and it consumes a very large amount of logical and physical resources, such as data file space, CPU, and memory. A sophisticated platform for efficient big data analytics is becoming more important these days as the data amount generated in a daily basis exceeds over quintillion bytes. Apache Spark MLlib is one of the most prominent platforms for big data analysis which offers a set of excellent functionalities for different machine learning tasks ranging from regression, classification, and dimension reduction to clustering and rule extraction. In this contribution, we explore, from the computational perspective, the expanding body of the Apache Spark MLlib 2.0 as an open-source, distributed, scalable, and platform independent machine learning library. Specifically, we perform several real world machine learning experiments to examine the qualitative and quantitative attributes of the platform. Furthermore, we highlight current trends in big data machine learning research and provide insights for future work.",

      "abstract": "Big data analytics and business insights are of high importance and demand among today’s services and applications. Traditionally, the entire big data pipeline goes through numerous processing steps. However, the complexity of supporting big data analytic applications is more than its recent reputation would suggest. On top of hybrid big data and high-performance computing resources, this paper presents a comprehensive microservices architecture to ease the management and enactment of end-to-end big data workflow management processes. It is developed along with intuitive graphical user interfaces to abstract and hide to the end user the specificities of the underlying network, storage and compute infrastructure. Entitled as Big Data Apps Composition Environment, it facilitates the design, composition, configuration, orchestration, enactment, and validation of end-to-end big data analytic services actuated into deployment workflows. Our approach differentiates to the current engines, as it adopts a big data-driven methodology which is scalable to multiple executors and has embedded notebooks for on-demand and real-time scripting analytics. Therefore, big data services and analytic applications deployment are being accelerated, while semi-automatic scaling through the definition of multiple executors for improved time performance of demanding tasks is supported.",

      "abstract": "Summary form only given. Apache Spark has become one of the most popular engines for big data processing. Spark provides a platform-independent, high-abstraction programming paradigm for large-scale data processing by leveraging the Java frame-work. Though it provides software portability across various machines, Java also limits the performance of distributed environments, such as Spark. While it may be unrealistic to rewrite platforms like Spark in a faster language, a more viable approach to mitigate its poor performance is to accelerate the computations while still working within the Java-based framework. This work demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating FPGA acceleration into Spark, and uses a MapReduce implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm to show that acceleration is possible even when using a hardware platform that is not well-optimized for performance. An important feature of our approach is that the use of FPGAs is completely transparent to the user through the use of library functions, which is a common way by which users access functions provided by Spark. Power users can further develop other computations using high-level synthesis.",

Based on the analysis of the existing problems of Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark, this paper proposes to use Spark Streaming for real-time processing of massive stream data, and builds a prototype cluster, which proves the real-time analysis of log data (online log and offline log) and the real-time processing of network attack data. At the same time, a hybrid encryption method combining ECC encryption with block data encryption and a secret key generation method combining semiconductor noise source and chaotic sequence are proposed. The simulation results show that the efficiency and security of encryption are effectively guaranteed.",

      "abstract": "The advent of social networks and Internet-of-Things has resulted in unprecedented capability of collecting, sharing and analyzing massive amounts of data. From a security perspective, Big Data may seriously weaken confidentiality, as techniques for improving Big Data analytics performance-including early fusion of heterogeneous data sources - increase the hidden redundancy of data representation, generating ill-protected copies. This gray area of redundancy triggers new disclosure threats that challenge traditional techniques to protect privacy and confidentiality. This position paper starts by proposing a definition of the Big Data Leak threat (as opposed to the one of data breach) and its role as a component of disclosure risk. Then, it discusses how a paradigm of Known, Detect, Contain and Recover could be used to establish Big Data security practices for containing disclosure risks connected to Big Data analytics.",

The course of Big data acquisition and cleaning is the first professional core course of data science and big data technology. The course has many difficult knowledge points, involves many tools and software, is closely integrated with the application, and requires the high practical ability of students, so it is impossible to achieve the teaching purpose by the traditional teaching method. In this paper, based on the OBE concept, the teaching content, teaching methods, and course assessment methods are reformed.

Big image data classification has a wide range of applications, such as face recognition, object detection, and human posture recognition. Traditional methods for big image data classification usually ignore the close connection between different levels of features in neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new way for big image data classification that improves the previous method through the Multi-Level Feature Connection Network (MFC-Net). MFC-Net presents a multi-level feature connection module to mine more useful features for classification. Experiments show that MFC-Net significantly improves its baseline SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) and other advanced classification neural networks in the classic datasets Pascal VOC and Microsoft COCO.",

Several techniques have been proposed in literature to preserve privacy of collected data while storing and processing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware architecture for storing and processing data in a Big Data warehouse. In particular, we propose a flexible, extendable, and adaptable architecture that enforces user specified privacy requirements in the form of Embedded Privacy Agreements. The paper discusses the details of the architecture with some implementation details.",

      "abstract": "The era of big data is evolving with the introduction of the data lake concept. While a data warehouse provides a well-structured model to manage big data, a data lake accepts data of any types and formats with or without schema and provides access to the data for diverse communities of users. A data lake provides flexible, agile, and scalable solution to manage the ever-increasing volume of big data we are witnessing in the world today, including many siloed data collected over the years by researchers through Arctic expeditions. In this paper, we present our conceptual model of a data lake for integrating the diverse huge amount of data collected by researchers during Arctic expedition. We also design a baseline metadata using a data-driven approach to manage the disparately huge structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data collected from the Arctic region. The resulting open data lake not only effectively manages big Arctic data but also supports machine learning on these big data.",

The factor of scholars should be the most important parameter in the various college rankings, however, it seems not appear in the college ranking since it is difficult to evaluate it. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation system for the evaluation of scholar co-author network and citation chain based on big-data technique. The evaluation results are very close to the survey in the professional area.",

      "abstract": "with the continuous improvement of information construction, the vast majority of colleges and universities in China have begun to build digital campus, the construction of all teachers and students and school administrators have brought great convenience. With the construction of digital campus, colleges and universities will produce massive data every day, among which the data generated by students account for a large proportion. The data generated by students include scores, information on borrowing books, credit card information of dormitory access control and consumption data of campus one-card. By analyzing the behavioral data generated by students, some behavioral characteristics of students in school are found, which can provide a more scientific basis for the management of students. This paper makes use of the data such as the achievement information of students in a vocational college and the consumption information of campus one-card. Firstly, the original data is preprocessed so that the processed data can meet the basic requirements of data analysis. Then, the data after preprocessing is discretized with the data discretization technology so that the data can meet the requirements of the Apriori algorithm of association rules. Finally, Apriori algorithm is used to mine the correlation between students' academic performance and campus one-card consumption data.",

      "abstract": "As we are living in the era of big data, high volumes of wide varieties of data which may be of different veracity (e.g., precise data, imprecise and uncertain data) are easily generated or collected at a high velocity in many real-life applications. Embedded in these big data is valuable knowledge and useful information, which can be discovered by big data science solutions. As a popular data science task, frequent pattern mining aims to discover implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and valuable knowledge in terms of sets of frequently co-occurring merchandise items and/or events. Many of the existing frequent pattern mining algorithms use a transaction-centric mining approach to find frequent patterns from precise data. However, there are situations in which an item-centric mining approach is more appropriate, and there are also situations in which data are imprecise and uncertain. Hence, in this paper, we present an item-centric algorithm for mining frequent patterns from big uncertain data. In recent years, big data have been gaining the attention from the research community as driven by relevant technological innovations (e.g., clouds) and novel paradigms (e.g., social networks). As big data are typically published online to support knowledge management and fruition processes, these big data are usually handled by multiple owners with possible secure multi-part computation issues. Thus, privacy and security of big data has become a fundamental problem in this research context. In this paper, we present, not only an item-centric algorithm for mining frequent patterns from big uncertain data, but also a privacy-preserving algorithm. In other words, we present- in this paper-a privacy-preserving item-centric algorithm for mining frequent patterns from big uncertain data. Results of our analytical and empirical evaluation show the effectiveness of our algorithm in mining frequent patterns from big uncertain data in a privacy-preserving manner.",

However, big data has increased access to sensitive information that when processed can directly jeopardize the privacy of individuals and violate data protection laws. As a consequence, data controllers and data processors may be imposed tough penalties for non-compliance that can result even to bankruptcy. In this paper, we discuss the current state of the legal regulations and analyse different data protection and privacy-preserving techniques in the context of big data analysis. In addition, we present and analyse two real-life research projects as case studies dealing with sensitive data and actions for complying with the data regulation laws. We show which types of information might become a privacy risk, the employed privacy-preserving techniques in accordance with the legal requirements, and the influence of these techniques on the data processing phase and the research results.",

Investigators are more than ever confronted with vast amount of heterogeneous data, highly-diverse data formats, increased complexity in distributed stored information. With constantly increasing network bandwidth it makes extremely challenging to process or even store part of the network traffic. Nevertheless, criminal investigations need to solve crimes in a timely manners. New computational methods, infrastructure and algorithmic approaches are required. Although Big Data is a challenge for criminal investigators, it can also help them make to source an detect patterns to prevent and solve crimes. This paper aims to raise attention to current challenges in Cyber Crime Investigations - related to Big Data - and possible ways to approach combating cybercrimes.",

Based on the perspective of big data, we collect the relevant data of software design by using big data acquisition technology. Multiple regression linear equations are used to construct the software design prediction data model from four aspects, namely, applicable object population of software, the repair of software bugs, the download of new users, and user experience. The correlation coefficient between the prediction model and the actual data is 0.72228, which verifies the prediction model. Through the analysis and full consideration of the changeable factors in software design, the development of software design with standardization is proposed.",

There is a vital need to define the basic information/semantic models, architecture components and operational models that together comprise a socalled Big Data Ecosystem. This paper discusses a nature of Big Data that may originate from different scientific, industry and social activity domains and proposes improved Big Data definition that includes the following parts: Big Data properties (also called Big Data 5V: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity), data models and structures, data analytics, infrastructure and security. The paper discusses paradigm change from traditional host or service based to data centric architecture and operational models in Big Data. The Big Data Architecture Framework (BDAF) is proposed to address all aspects of the Big Data Ecosystem and includes the following components: Big Data Infrastructure, Big Data Analytics, Data structures and models, Big Data Lifecycle Management, Big Data Security. The paper analyses requirements to and provides suggestions how the mentioned above components can address the main Big Data challenges. The presented work intends to provide a consolidated view of the Big Data phenomena and related challenges to modern technologies, and initiate wide discussion.",

As facilities are gearing up for data intensive computing infrastructure, a wave of facility-based big science computing platforms is emerging. This paper presents a new computing paradigm towards designing HPC data analysis platform, named Data Optimised Computing (DOC). The DOC paradigm leverages the characteristics of science data to optimize HPC resource utilization and to improve users' ability to harness a variety of scientific analysis software frameworks. We present a preliminary architectural design of a software platform that implements this approach and also discuss the future directions of this work.",

      "abstract": "Big Data has attracted much attention in academia and industry fields in the last few years. The trend of utilizing medical big data has increased tremendously as well. The medical big data is generated from medical records, medicine, research, etc. but it is not well connected due to its long-term development in last decades in most hospitals without high-level strategic guide and plan. The information missing, data dispersivity, information isolated island, redundancy problems are key to the failure of the big data platform which is used to manage the medical data asset. We propose a platform called Data Mid-Platform (DMP) to solve the above problems and serve other big data projects as well as scientific assignments. The feasibility of this mid-platform is highly recommended and certified by several domain experts and it is under construction in a real project. It aims to satisfy at least 3 to 5 years big data applications development under the perspective of big data top-level design.",

However, the growth in the use of big data has outstripped the knowledge of how to support teams that need to do big data projects. In fact, while much has been written in terms of the use of algorithms that can help generate insightful analysis, much less has been written about methodologies, tools and frameworks that could enable teams to more effectively and efficiently \"do\" big data projects. Hence, this paper discusses the key research questions relating methodologies, tools and frameworks to improve big data team effectiveness as well as the potential goals for a big data process methodology. Finally, the paper also discusses related domains, such as software development, operations research and business intelligence, since these fields might provide insight into how to define a big data process methodology.",

Research experiments are also generating huge amount of data which are to be collected, managed and analyzed. This huge data is known as \"Big Data\". Research analysts have perceived an increase in data that contains both useful and useless entities. In extraction of useful information, data warehouse finds difficulties in enduring with increasing amount of data generated. With shifts in paradigm, big data analytics emerged as promising area of research which supports business intelligence in terms of decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on BigData, BigData problems, BigData Analytics and Big Data Warehouse. In addition, it also explains how the need for augmentation of big data and data warehouse emerged in perspective of decision making, comparing methods and research problems. It also elaborates applications which support Big Data, Data Warehouse, and its challenges.",

To some extent, this provides a risk response plan for gridding service and management. However, when using big data to realize gridding management, there are also many problems, such as the discretization of multiple governance subjects, the separation of data resources, the limitations of data sharing, and the vulnerability of data security. In order to make better use of big data to improve the level of grid management, the government needs to improve the top-level design and system construction from the macro level, the technical system and talent training from the medium level, and the privacy protection and data security from the micro level.",

Because the technologies demand a large number of resources, studies on a distributed cloud including a hybrid cloud technology are needed. However, there are limitations of performance and cost since the most of hospitals use the private cloud of low computing resource. Thus, a research on the hybrid cloud is required to resolve the limitations. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a system called BigPros for medical big data processing with the proposed workflow model in the hybrid cloud resolving above issues. Based on this study, the BigPros can provide an efficient data processing method for a medical big data analytics in the hybrid cloud environment.",

Moreover, large financial organizations have hundreds of millions of financial contracts on their balance sheets. Since there is no standard for modelling financial data, current financial risk algorithms are typically inconsistent and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of a real-world use case for performing large-scale financial risk analytics leveraging Big Data technology. Our performance evaluation demonstrates almost linear scalability.",

      "abstract": "Mobile is increasingly ubiquitous. With 6.8 billion mobile subscriptions world wide, access anytime, anywhere through smart gadgets is now putting cheap and connected, mobile computing power in the hands of millions of consumers and healthcare practitioners. Mobile Sensors -- accelerometers, location detection, wireless connectivity and cameras -- offer another big step towards closing the feedback loop in personalized medicine. There is no more personal data than on the-body or in-the-body sensors. With so many connected devices generating various vital health related data, integrating these data points to Electronic Health Records not only provide more accurate picture of the patient but also helps to connect with the doctor. In this paper, we propose Sensor integration framework with Electronic Health Records (EHR). Finally, the paper presents a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.",

      "abstract": "Now sports tourism is very popular, but there is still a lack of platform for integrating sports tourism information data in the market. Big data technology can solve this problem. This paper uses big data technology to build a sports tourism information data model. Big data technology can help the model collect structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, use Hadoop and PMP engine to initially calculate and process these data, and then reprocess the processed data. Finally, the processed data is provided to the high-level by resource scheduling and service interface. This model can integrate the sports event information released by the official information on the network, recommend it to users, help users understand the information data related to sports tourism, and help the development of sports tourism.",

Our proposed novel system, which extracts the important topics or issues from Skype customer feedback sources and measures the emotion associated with those topics using Vibe metric, can be a good example in this area. Unlike other previous research, which has focused on extracting the user sentiments either globally or in separate topics, our work focuses on tracking the correlated emotional trajectories across all the important issues from Skype customer feedback over time. Moreover, it also provides a platform for both studying customer emotions and tracking how the emotions regarding different important topics correlatively change over time by leveraging unstructured textual customer feedback data and structured user activity telemetry data.",

In addition, the new wave of digitizing medical records has seen a paradigm shift in the healthcare industry. As a result, the healthcare industry is witnessing an increase in sheer volume of data in terms of complexity, diversity and timeliness. As healthcare experts look for every possible way to lower costs while improving care process, delivery and management, big data emerges as a plausible solution with the promise to transform the healthcare industry. This paradigm shift from reactive to proactive healthcare can result in an overall decrease in healthcare costs and eventually lead to economic growth. While the healthcare industry harnesses the power of big data, security and privacy issues are at the focal point as emerging threats and vulnerabilities continue to grow. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art security and privacy issues in big data as applied to healthcare industry.",

To alleviate this problem, approximate query processing (AQP) was adopted, which provides approximate results with error bounds. The AQP models which have been proposed are supported only by a single database. In an organization, big data is stored in multiple databases that have different data models. This research aims to provide AQP as a middleware solution using query optimization for heterogeneous databases.",

      "abstract": "Big data analytic (BDA) systems leverage data distribution and parallel processing across a cluster of resources. This introduces a number of new challenges specifically for analytics. The analytics portion of the complete lifecycle has typically followed a waterfall process - completing one step before beginning the next. While efforts have been made to map different types of analytics to an agile methodology, the steps are often described as breaking activities into smaller tasks while the overall process is still consistent with step-by-step waterfall. BDA changes a number of the activities in the analytics lifecycle, as well as their ordering. The goal of agile analytics - to reach a point of optimality between generating value from data and the time spent getting there. This paper discusses the implications of an agile process for BDA in cleansing, transformation, and analytics.",

However, there is no guarantee that this Web of Data will provide the consumer with truthful and valuable information. Most research has focused on Big Data's Volume, Velocity, and Variety dimensions. Unfortunately, Veracity and Value, often regarded as the fourth and fifth dimensions, have been largely overlooked. In this paper we discuss the potential of Linked Data methods to tackle all five V's, and particularly propose methods for addressing the last two dimensions. We draw parallels between Linked and Big Data methods, and propose the application of existing methods to improve and maintain quality and address Big Data's veracity challenge.",

The ability of organizations to manage these projects has so far not kept pace - they need better ways to analyze the behavior of their Big Data projects and positively affect outcomes. The objective of this paper is to identify the important dynamic characteristics of Big Data projects, and explore how a modeling and simulation technique called system dynamics (SD) can be applied these characteristics. The approach draws from applicable concepts in the domains of traditional project management, Agile software development and Lean product development, and proposes to develop a model called Big Data Project Dynamics (BDPD) incorporating these insights. The BDPD model is organized into sectors: Core Rework Cycle, Iterative & Incremental, Exploration & Learning, Economic Value, and Policy Actions & Consequences. Given ADPD, practitioners can simulate Big Data project behavior from initial conditions, and probabilistically predict project outcomes.",

How to extract knowledge from mass and multi-modal data is a major challenge for manufacturing enterprises. The overall framework of enterprise knowledge retrieval based on industrial big data is proposed in this paper, which is analyzed from five levels: data source, multi-modal data management, data fusion modeling, knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. The knowledge graph technology is applied to multi-modal data association and the knowledge graph of enterprise radar product development is constructed. Based on knowledge graph, intelligent semantic retrieval and knowledge recommendation based on recommendation algorithm, we initially explored the utilization of industrial big data from the aspect of knowledge application. The enterprise knowledge unified retrieval method based on industrial big data proposed in this paper provides a reference for manufacturing enterprises to make use of industrial big data.",

Multimedia Big Data Computing is the new topic that focus on all aspects of distributed computing systems that enable massive scale image and video analytics. During the course of this paper we describe BPEM (Big Picture Event Monitor), a Multimedia Big Data Computing framework that operates over streams of digital photos generated by online communities, and enables monitoring the relationship between real world events and social media user reaction in real-time. As a case example, the paper examines publicly available social media data that relate to the Mobile World Congress 2014 that has been harvested and analyzed using the described system.",

Business adopts one or more of the above properties to cater to the requirements of the clients. Data being crucial in this case has different facets. The sources of data being different and consumption across different businesses makes the data modeling a tougher problem. Data schema evolves with new sources of data, changes due to change in data sources, etc Thus enrichment of data constantly triggers the needs to device methods to adopt the models to the new patterns. When the enrichment patterns are understood, modeling the Big Data and Management becomes easy. We highlight the list of such identified patterns based upon our real world implementations. In this work, we propose a method to evolve the data models from its initially defined schema such that data models can easily adapt to changes. We show through cases studies from real world example that our model can adopt to evolve data from different sources.",

      "abstract": "Cloud computing is a promising cost efficient service oriented computing platform in the fields of science, engineering, business and social networking for delivering the resources on demand. Big Data Clouds is a new generation data analytics platform using Cloud computing as a back end technologies, for information mining, knowledge discovery and decision making based on statistical and empirical tools. MapReduce scheduling models for Big Data computing operate in the cluster mode, where the data nodes are pre-configured with the computing facility for processing. These MapReduce models are based on compute push model-pushing the logic to the data node for analysis, which is primarily for minimizing or eliminating data migration overheads between computing resources and data nodes. Such models, however, substantially perform well in the cluster setups, but are infelicitous for the platforms having the decoupled data storage and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a Genetic Algorithm based scheduler for such Big Data Cloud where decoupled computational and data services are offered as services. The approach is based on evolutionary methods focussed on data dependencies, computational resources and effective utilization of bandwidth thus achieving higher throughputs.",

      "abstract": "The data has become an island within the application, indicating that the data has not been fully utilized. Throughout the current performance ranking, almost all enterprises are data-driven enterprises. However, several challenges prevent them from making full use of all data, lack of data access, numerous data sources and data types, and complex data integration. Research shows that in most enterprises, up to 74% of the data has not been analyzed, and up to 82 % of enterprises are restricted by data islands. In order to solve the above problems, this paper designs a metadata based data fabric system architecture (M-Data-Fabric). M-Data-Fabric realizes the overall use of different data sources rather than reuse according to the process of metadata identification, analysis, integration, integration and knowledge map construction. By analyzing the relationship between data sources, metadata is aggregated through strong business After correlation, the whole business knowledge map is obtained.",

Using bibliometric records of articles downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS), this study utilizes the co-occurrence data between Subject Categories (SCs) related to Big Data research to discover the structure and pattern of the interdisciplinary network; its distribution and evolution over time; and the structural communities of interdisciplinary collaboration. The study also provides visualizations of these interdisciplinary networks. Additionally, this study measures the degree of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research based on the co-occurrences of SCs of the related research publications using Stirling's Diversity Index and Specialization Index.",

Particularly, the use of data mining to predict students' academic performance has been explored by educators to optimize teaching decisions. By contrast, there still lacks a set of cohesive frameworks on how to use this big data technology in college English teaching, and how to incorporate data mining into a warning system needs to be further elucidated. In this context, we first analyzed the necessity of early warning for the college English academic performance, and then expatiated the development paths and implementation frameworks based on big data. We studied the technical framework of early warning for the college English academic performance to help teachers find problems and improve English teaching effects.",

The software libraries that are available at today are not suitable for displaying huge volumes of data in a single chart, because they require all the data to be collected at a single node. In this work, an innovative approach to the problem is presented, that consists in using a network of cyber-devices that is created and configured via API calls and that interfaces with a Scala Spark server application through a multiplicity of communication technologies, to produce and display a variety of time-space- infinite Big Data stream visualizations, including line plots, pie charts, histograms, that are updated at real-time as new data come, without ever collecting the data or the charts markup at a single node. The proposed approach characterizes for being (i) Web-based, (ii) API-based, (iii) Cloud-based, (iv) portable, (v) customizable/extendable, (vi) plug and play, and for relying on (i) Node-RED, (ii) MQTT, (iii) Scala, (iv) Akka HTTP, (v) Spark, (vi) Kafka, (vii) Docker. Remarkably, the same network used for Big Data visualization can be reconfigured in a matter of milliseconds and used for Big Data (streams) filtering, transformation, merge, analytics, and for training Machine Learning models, storing trained models on a Cloud storage, using stored models for one-shot or stream predictions, and much more. Although being at an advanced stage, we consider this research as a work in progress, since an extensive benchmarking and application to variegated real-world scenarios are still to be carried out.",

In this paper, we present a credible big data sharing model based on blockchain technology and smart contract to ensure the safe circulation of data resources.",

In the case of high concurrency, it provides users with a variety of high real-time data services to meet the requirements of real-time, high availability, and high scalability, and solves the problems of high-concurrency user interaction and massive data storage and transmission in virtual reality systems. The distributed server cluster system can customize different policies according to specific business and cooperate with cloud computer resources to ensure data security and transmission efficiency. The experimental results show that the modules and algorithms of the system designed in this paper can run correctly, and the distributed server cluster system designed in this paper can meet the needs and goals of large-scale virtual reality scenarios.",

In order to cultivate more talented people satisfying the needs of the community, we have designed the big data course for undergraduates. The big data course stresses not only on many theories but also lots of practice. The project of “big data talent development trend analysis” is designed in the experimental teaching on big data. By doing this project, students can master all the technologies of big data processing lifecycle, including data collection, data preprocessing, data mining and data visualization. We evaluate students who master big data core technology with a multi-evaluation method and design the experiment evaluation system on big data. Through our two years' practice, the results show that all these designs have achieved the good effect and improved the teaching quality.",

At present, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the literature in this field, and it is difficult to understand the research focus and trends in the field of big data. This paper obtains data from CNKI, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and selects articles related to big data published between 2017 and 2020 as the research sample, and uses Python to visualize word frequency, co-word cluster analysis and analysis on the keywords and topics of the paper. This article mainly explains the major countries (regions), core research fields and related research hotspots involved in the research of academic articles of big data in recent years.The visualization results show that the research hotspots of academic articles on big mathematics involve many aspects such as artificial intelligence, economic and financial forecasting, policy management analysis, data information. As current domestic related research is mostly confined to academic papers, we believe that existing academic terms The scope of research needs to be expanded. The big data information industry and other industries should be increased, interdisciplinary cooperation, and focus on strengthening the academic research on medical, psychological, and big data of some algorithm innovation.",

      "abstract": "In an era where big data analytics has become a first-class requirement for both the industrial and the academic community, multiple engines are built to execute distributed domain-specific analytics. SQL-based big data analytics is a very popular but also challenging domain due to its complexity that requires multiple runtime query optimizations. Popular frameworks, such as Presto and SparkSQL, commonly retrieve data from multiple sources and process them locally using domain-specific optimizers. However, recent work indicates that no single engine offers the optimal all-in-one solution for all types of SQL queries. Taking this into account, we envision building an optimizer to facilitate faster distributed SQL analytics over multiple engines, which will perform operator-level optimization using Machine Learning techniques and will exploit the sophisticated data-driven local engine optimizations.",
